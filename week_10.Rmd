#10.1 Introduction


##Packages

Before we do any of this, we need to load the libraries we will use today:

```{r}
library(sf)
library(tmap)
library(sp)
library(spdep)
library(DCluster)
library(cartogram)
library(ggmap)
library(ggplot2)
```


There are also some new libraries we will use. If you don't already have these you will need to install them. 

##Pro-tip: do I need to install this package?

You might have noticed that in your list of available packages you might see more than you remember downloading. The idea of *dependencies* has come up throughout the semester. Packages have *dependencies* when their code is *dependent* on (uses code from) another package. For example, if I write some code that I think will be useful, so I release this in the form of the package "rekaR", but I use ggplot2 in the code, then ggplot2 will be a dependency of rekaR. As a default, R will install all the dependencies for a package when you install your package. So this way you might end up with some packages there that you didn't realise you had. 


Why am I telling you this? Well you should always check if you have a package, before installing it. And I wanted to share with you some neat code [PROPERLY REFERENCE SOURCE HERE]() to do this. I'll comment it a bit, so you can follow along what it does **but you don't have to if you don't want to**. This is just an optional extra. 


So as a first step, you have to assign a list of all the packages you have to check to an object. Let's say I tell you that today we will be using the following packaes: "sp", "rgdal", "classInt", "RColorBrewer", "ggplot2", "hexbin", "ggmap", "XML", and "dplyr". Then you can add these to an object called `libs`, using the `c()` function: 


```{r}
libs <- c("sf", "tmap", "sp", "spdep", "DCluster", "cartogram")

```

Now you can run the below bit of code, and you will see in the console an output of what is and isn't installed, as well as install the packages that are not!

```{r}

for (x in libs){                                                #cycle through each item in libs object
  if(x %in% rownames(installed.packages()) == FALSE) {          #if the package is not installed
    print(paste0("installing ", x, "..."))                      #print a message to tell me
    install.packages(x)                                         #and then install the packages
  }
  else{                                                         #otherwise (if it is installed)
    print (paste0(x, " is already installed "))                 #print a message to tell me
  }
  library(x, character.only = TRUE)                             #and then load the packages
}

```


As you can see if you read through the comments there, this bit of code checks each package in the list you pass to tbe `libs` object when you create it, and if it is not installed it installs for you, and if it is, it just loads it for you. It can be a handy bit of code to keep around. 

##Data

Then we will bring back the data from last week:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
##R in Windows have some problems with https addresses, that's why we need to do this first:
urlfile<-'https://s3.amazonaws.com/geoda/data/ncovr.zip'
download.file(urlfile, 'ncovr.zip')
#Let's unzip and create a new directory (ncovr) in our working directory to place the files
unzip('ncovr.zip', exdir = 'ncovr')

```

Remember that to treat the data as spatial we need to load the shapefile. With that we can create a spatial object:

```{r}
shp_name <- "ncovr/ncovr/NAT.shp"
ncovr_sf <- st_read(shp_name)
```

#10.2 Interpreting Spatial Lag Coefficiences

Today we are mostly going to go back to some issues about geographical representation (mapping rates, bins) and other more general issues that are quite revelant when we talk about spatial analysis, and are integral part of a spatial analysis course (e.g., the modifiable area unit problem). But before we do any of that we need to go back to something we mentioned last week about the spatial lag models.

Remember that last week we fitted the following spatial lag model after creating a spatial weight matrix based on Queen first order neighbours:

```{r}
#Split the data into Southern and Northern counties
ncovr_s_sf <- subset(ncovr_sf, SOUTH == 1)
ncovr_n_sf <- subset(ncovr_sf, SOUTH == 0)
#We coerce the sf object into a new sp object
ncovr_n_sp <- as(ncovr_n_sf, "Spatial")
#Then we create a list of neighbours using the Queen criteria
w_n <- poly2nb(ncovr_n_sp, row.names=ncovr_n_sp$FIPSNO)
wm_n <- nb2mat(w_n, style='B')
rwm_n <- mat2listw(wm_n, style='W')
#Fit model
fit_1_lag <- lagsarlm(HR60 ~ RD60 + DV60 + MA60 + PS60 +UE60, data=ncovr_n_sf, rwm_n)
summary(fit_1_lag)
```

Remember what we said last week:

"Interpreting  the substantive  effects  of  each  predictor  in  a spatial lag  model  is  much  more  complex  than  in  a nonspatial model (or in a spatial error model) because of the presence of the spatial multiplier that links  the  independent  variables  to  the  dependent.  In  the nonspatial model,  it  does  not  matter which unit is experiencing the change on the independent variable. The effect" in the dependent variable "of a change" in the value of an independent variable "is constant across all observations" (Darmofal, 2015: 107). Remember we say, when interpreting a regression coefficient for variable X~i,  that they indicate how much Y goes up or down for every one unit increase in X~i  when holding all other variables in the model constant. In our example, for the nonspatial model this effect is the same  for  every  county  in  our  dataset.  But  in  the  spatial  lag  model  things  are  not  the  same.  We cannot interpret the regression coefficients for the substantive predictors in the same way because the "substantive effects of the independent variables vary by observation as a result of the different neighbors for each unit in the data" (Darmofal, 2015: 107).

In  the  OLS  regression  model,  the  coefficients  for  any  of  the  explanatory  variables  measure  the absolute impact of these variables. It is a simpler scenario. We look at the effect of X in Y within each county. So X in county A affects Y in count A. In the spatial lag model there are two components to how  X  affect  Y.  X  affects  Y  within  each  county  directly  but  remember  we  are  also  including  the spatial, the measure of Y in the surrounding counties (call them B, C, and D). So our model includes not only the effect of X in county A in the level of Y in county A. By virtues of including the spatial lag (a measure of Y in county B, C and D) we are indirectly incorporating as well the effects that X has on Y in  counties  B,  C,  and  D.  So  the  effect  of  a  covariate  (independent  variable)  is  the  sum  of  two particular effects: a direct, local effect of the covariate in that unit, and an indirect, spillover effect due to the spatial lag.

This implies that a change in the ith region’s predictor can affect the jth region’s outcome. We have 2 situations: (a) the direct impact of an observation’s predictor on its own outcome, and (b) the indirect impact of an observation’s neighbor’s predictor on its outcome.This leads to three quantities that we want to know:

-Average Direct Impact, which is similar to a traditional interpretation
-Average Total impact, which would be the total of direct and indirect impacts of a predictor on one’s outcome
-Average Indirect impact, which would be the average impact of one’s neighbors on one’s outcome

These quantities can be found using the impacts() function in the spdep library. We follow the example that converts the spatial weight matrix into a “sparse” matrix, and power it up using the trW() function. This follows the approximation methods described in Lesage and Pace, 2009. Here, we use Monte Carlo simulation to obtain simulated distributions of the various impacts. 

```{r}
W <- as(rwm_n, "CsparseMatrix")
trMC <- trW(W, type="MC")
im<-impacts(fit_1_lag, tr=trMC, R=100)
sums<-summary(im,  zstats=T)
#To print the coefficients
data.frame(sums$res)
```

```{r}
#To print the p balues
data.frame(sums$pzmat)
```

We see that all the variables have signficant direct, indirect and total effects. You may want to have a look at how things differ when you just run a non spatial model.

```{r}
fit_1_OLS <- lm(HR60 ~ RD60 + DV60 + MA60 + PS60 +UE60, data=ncovr_n_sf)
summary(fit_1_OLS)
```


#10.3 Mapping rates, learning from disease mapping

In previous sessions we discussed how to map rates. It seems a fairly straightoforward issue. You get your variable with the relevant rate and you map it using a choropleth map. However, things are not that simple. Rates are funny animals. Let's look at the ncvor data. 

```{r}
summary(ncovr_sf$HR60)
```

We can see that the county with the highest homicide rate in the 1960s had a rate of 92.937 homicides per 100,000 individuals. That is very high. Just to put it into context in the UK is about 0.92. Where is that place? I can tell you is a place call Borden. Check it out:

```{r}
borden <- subset(ncovr_sf, NAME == "Borden")
borden$HR60

```

Borden county in Texas. You may be thinking… “Texas Chainsaw Massacre” perhaps? No, not really. Ed Gein, who inspired the film, was based and operated in Wisconsin. Borden claim to fame is that it was named after Gail Borden, the inventor of condensed milk. So, what’s going on here? Why do we have a homicide rate in Borden that makes it look like a war zone or the setting for Midsomer Murders? 

Check this out too:

```{r}
borden$HC60
```

What? A total homicide count of 1. How can a county with just one homicide have a rate that makes it look like the most dangerous place in the US?

```{r}
borden$PO60
```

Well, there were about 1076 people living there.

```{r}
summary(ncovr_sf$PO60)

```

If you contrast that with the average county in the US, that's tiny. One homicide in such a small place can end up producing a big rate. Remember that the rate is simply dividing the number of relevant events by the exposure variable (in this case population) and multiplying by a constant (in this case 100,000 since we expressed crime rates in those terms). Most times Borden is a very peaceful place:

```{r}
borden$HR70
borden$HR80
borden$HR90
```

It has a homicide rate of 0. But it only takes one homicide and, bang, it goes top of the league. So a standard map of rates is bound to be noisy. There is the instability that is introduced by virtue of having areas that may be sparsely populated and in which one single event, like in this case, will produce a very noticeable change in the rate. In fact, if you look at the counties with the highest homicide rate in the ncovr dataset you will notice all of them are places like Borden, areas that are sparsely populated, not because they are that dangerous, but because of the instability of rates.

This is a problem that was first noted by epidemiologists doing disease mapping. But a number of other disciplines have now noted this and used some of the approaches developed by public health researchers that confronted this problem when producing maps of disease (PRO TIP: techniques and approaches used by spatial epidemiologists are very similar to those used by criminologists -in case you ever think of changing careers or need inspiration for how to solve a crime analysis problem).

One way of dealing with this is by smoothing the rates. This basically as the word implies aims for a smoother representation that avoids hard spikes associated with random noise. There are different ways of doing that. Some ways use a non-spatial approach to smoothing, using something called a empirical bayesian smoother. How does this work? This approach takes the raw rates and tries to “shrunk” them towards the overall average. What does this mean? Essentially, we compute a weighted average between the raw rate for each area and the global average across all areas, with weights proportional to the underlying population at risk. What this procedure does is to have the rates of smaller areas (those with a small population at risk) to have their rates adjusted considerably (brought closer to the global average), whereas the rates for the larger areas will barely change.

Here we are going to introduce the approach implemented in DCluster, a package developed for epidemiological research and detection of [clusters of disease](https://www.r-project.org/conferences/DSC-2003/Proceedings/GomezRubioEtAl.pdf).

```{r}
res <- empbaysmooth(ncovr_sf$HC60, ncovr_sf$PO60)
```

In the new object we generate, which is a list, you have an element which contains the computed rates. We can add those to our dataset:

```{r}
ncovr_sf$HR60EBS <- res$smthrr * 100000
```

Instead of shrinking to the global rate, we can shrink to a rate based on the neighbours of each county. If instead of shrinking to a global rate, we shrink to a local rate, we may be able to take unobserved heterogeneity into account; for this we need the list of neighbours (created as we covered in previous sessions):

```{r}
ncovr_sp <- as(ncovr_sf, "Spatial")
w_nb <- poly2nb(ncovr_sp, row.names=ncovr_sp$FIPSNO)
eb2 <- EBlocal(ncovr_sf$HC60, ncovr_sf$PO60, w_nb)
ncovr_sf$HR60EBSL <- eb2$est * 100000

```

We can now plot the maps and compare them:

```{r}
current_style <- tmap_style("col_blind")

map1<- tm_shape(ncovr_sf) + 
  tm_fill("HR60", style="quantile", title = "Raw rate", palette = "Reds") +
  tm_layout(legend.position = c("left", "bottom"), 
            legend.title.size = 0.8,
            legend.text.size = 0.5)

map2<- tm_shape(ncovr_sf) + 
  tm_fill("HR60EBS", style="quantile", title = "EB Smooth", palette = "Reds") +
  tm_layout(legend.position = c("left", "bottom"), 
            legend.title.size = 0.8,
            legend.text.size = 0.5)

map3<- tm_shape(ncovr_sf) + 
  tm_fill("HR60EBSL", style="quantile", title = "Local Smooth", palette = "Reds") +
  tm_layout(legend.position = c("left", "bottom"), 
            legend.title.size = 0.8,
            legend.text.size = 0.5)

tmap_arrange(map1, map2, map3) 
```

Notice that the quantiles are not the same, so that will make your comparison difficult.

#10.3 Binning

In GIS it is often difficult to present point-based data because in many instances there are several different points and data symbologies that need to be shown. As the number of different data points grows they can become complicated to interpret and manage which can result in convoluted and sometimes inaccurate maps. This becomes an even larger problem in web maps that are able to be depicted at different scales because smaller scale maps need to show more area and more data. This makes the maps convoluted if multiple data points are included.

In many maps there are so many data points included that little can be interpreted from them. In order to reduce congestion on maps many GIS users and cartographers have turned to a process known as binning. 


> **Binning** is defined as the process of grouping pairs of locations based on their distance from one another. These points can then be grouped as categories to make less complex and more meaningful maps.

Researchers and practitioners often require a way to systematically divide a region into equal-sized portions. As well as making maps with many points easier to read, binning data into regions can help identify spatial influence of neighbourhoods, and can be an essential step in developing systematic sampling designs.

This approach to binning generates an array of repeating shapes over a user-specified area. These shapes can be hexagons, squares, rectangles, triangles, circles or points, and they can be generated with any directional orientation.


![](http://www.jennessent.com/images/shape_patterns_manual.jpg)


##The Binning Process

Binning is a data modification technique that changes the way data is shown at small scales. It is done in the pre-processing stage of data analysis to convert the original data values into a range of small intervals, known as a bin. These bins are then replaced by a value that is representative of the interval to reduce the number of data points.

Spatial binning (also called *spatial discretization*) discretizes the location values into a small number of groups associated with geographical areas or shapes. The assignment of a location to a group can be done by any of the following methods:
 - Using the coordinates of the point to identify which "bin" it belongs to. 
 - Using a common variable in the attribute table of the bin and the point layers.


##Different Binning Techniques


Binning itself is a general term used to describe the grouping of a dataset's values into smaller groups [(Johnson, 2011)](http://indiemaps.com/blog/2011/10/hexbins/). The bins can be based on a variety of factors and attributes such as spatial and temporal and can thus be used for many different projects. 


###Choropleth maps 
You might be thinkging, "grouping points into a larger spatial unit, haven't we already done this when making choropleth maps?". In a way you are right. Choropleth maps are another type of map to that uses binning. Proportional symbol and choropleth maps group similar data points together to show a range of data instead of many individual points. We've covered this extensively, and is generally the best approch to consider spatial grouping of your point variables, because the polygons (shapes) to which you are aggregating your points are *meaningful*. You can group into LSOAs because you want to show variation in neighbourhoods. Or you can group into police force areas because you want to look at differences between those units of analysis. But sometimes there is just not a geography present to meet your needs. 


Let's say you are conducting some days of action in Manchester city centre, focusing on antisocial behaviour. You are going to put up some information booths and staff them with officers to engage with the local population about antiscoail behaviour. For these to be most effective, as an analyst you decide that they should go into the areas with the highest *count* of antisocial beaviour. You want to be very specific about where you put these as well, and so LSOA level would be too broad, you want to zoom in more. One approach can be to split central Manchester into some smaller polygons, and just calculate the number of antisocial behaviour incidents recorded in each. That way you can then decide to put your information booths somewhere inside the top 5 highest count bins. 



###Rectangular binning 

The aggregation of incident point data to regularly shaped grids is used for many reasons such as normalizing geography for mapping or to mitigate the issues of using irregularly shaped polygons created arbitrarily (such as county boundaries or block groups that have been created from a political process). Regularly shaped grids can only be comprised of equilateral triangles, squares, or hexagons, as these three polygon shapes are the only three that can tessellate (repeating the same shape over and over again, edge to edge, to cover an area without gaps or overlaps) to create an evenly spaced grid. 

Rectangular binning is the simplest binning method and as such it heavily used. However, there are some reasons why rectangular bins are less preferable over hexagonal bins. Before we cover this, let's have a look at hexagonal bins.


###Hexagonal binning 

In many applications binning is done using a technique called **hexagonal binning**. This technique uses hexagon shapes to create a grid of points and develops a spatial histogram that shows different data points as a range or group of pairs with common distances and directions. In hexagonal binning the number of points falling within a particular rectangular or hexagon in a gridded surface is what makes the different colors to easily visualize data [(Smith, 2012)](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/binning-alternative-point-maps/). Hexagonnal binning was first developed in 1987 and today “hexbinning” is conducted by laying a hexagonal grid on top of 2-dimensional data [(Johnson, 2011)](http://indiemaps.com/blog/2011/10/hexbins/). Once this is done users can conduct data point counts to determine the number of points for each hexagon [(Johnson, 2011)](http://indiemaps.com/blog/2011/10/hexbins/). The bins are then symbolized differently to show meaningful patterns in the data.


So how can we use hexbinning to solve our antisocial behaviour days of action task? Well let's say we split Manchester city centre into hexagons, and count the number of antisocial behaviour instances in these. We can then identify the top hexagons, and locate our booths somewhere within these. 

First make sure you have the appropriate packages loaded: 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggmap)
library(hexbin)
```


Also let's get some data. You could go and get this data yourself from police.uk, we've been through all the steps for downloading data from there a few times now. But for now, I have a tidied set of data ready for you. This data is one year's worth of antisocial behaviour from the [police.uk](data.police.uk) data, from May 2016 to May 2017, for the borough of Manchester. You can download from the dropbox link here: 



```{r}

manchester_asb <- read.csv("https://www.dropbox.com/s/4tk0aps3jfd9nh4/manchester_asb.csv?dl=1")

```


As a first step, we can plot asb in the borough of Manchester using simple ggplot! Remember the data visualisation session from weeks ago? We discussed how ggplot is such a great tool for building visualisations, because you can apply whatever geometry best suits your data. So for us to just have a look at the hexbinned version of our point data of antisocial behaviour, we can use the `stat_binhex()` function. We can also recreate the thematic map element, as we can use the frequency of points in each hex to shade each hexbin from white (least number of incidents) to red (most nuber of incidents). 


So let's have a go: 


```{r}

ggplot(manchester_asb, aes(Latitude, Longitude)) +                        #define data and variables for x and y axes
  stat_binhex() +                                                         #add binhex layer (hexbin)
  scale_fill_gradientn(colours = c("white","red"), name = "Frequency")    #add shading based on number of ASB incidents

```


Neat, but doesn't quite tell us *where* that really dark hexbon actually is. So it would be much better if we could do this with a basemap as the backrgound, rather than our grey ggplot theme. To do this, we can make use of ggmap. First download the baselayer for Manchester using ggmap's `get_map()` function: 

```{r}

# get the basemap
mcr_basemap <- get_map(location="Manchester, UK", zoom=12, maptype = 'roadmap')

# take a look
ggmap(mcr_basemap)

```


Now, we can apply the same code as we used above, for the ggplot, to this ggmap, to add our hexbins on top of this basemap: 


```{r}

ggmap(mcr_basemap) +                                       #load basemap
  coord_cartesian() +                                      #make sure our coords are in a cartesian coordinate system. To learn more see ?coord_cartesian()
  stat_binhex(data = manchester_asb,                       #use stat_binhex with arguments like in ggplot
              aes(x = Longitude, 
                  y = Latitude)) + 
  scale_fill_gradientn(colours = c("white","red"),         #use fillx with arguments like in ggplot 
                       name = "Frequency")


```


Now this should give you some more context! Woo!



So I mentioned we'd go over some reasons why you should  consider aggregating into a hexagon grid rather than other shapes. Here are some from the [](): 

- Hexagons reduce sampling bias due to [edge effects](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-0-387-09688-9_5) of the grid shape. The edge effects of bounded space refers to the problem of truncated data that can skew the results of subsequent analyses (we'll get to this in the next section). This is related to the low perimeter-to-area ratio of the shape of the hexagon. A circle has the lowest ratio but cannot tessellate to form a continuous grid. Hexagons are the most circular-shaped polygon that can tessellate to form an evenly spaced grid.
- This circularity of a hexagon grid allows it to represent curves in the patterns of your data more naturally than square grids.
- When comparing polygons with equal areas, the more similar to a circle the polygon is, the closer to the centroid the points near the border are (especially points near the vertices). This means that any point inside a hexagon is closer to the centroid of the hexagon than any given point in an equal-area square or triangle would be (this is due to the more acute angles of the square and triangle versus the hexagon).
- Hexagons are preferable when your analysis includes aspects of connectivity or movement paths. Due to the linear nature of rectangles, fishnet grids can draw our eyes to the straight, unbroken, parallel lines which may inhibit the underlying patterns in the data. Hexagons tend to break up the lines and allow any curvature of the patterns in the data to be seen more clearly and easily. This breakup of artificial linear patterns also diminishes any orientation bias that can be perceived in fishnet grids.
- If you are working over a large area, a hexagon grid will suffer less distortion due to the curvature of the earth than the shape of a fishnet grid.
- Finding neighbors is more straightforward with a hexagon grid. Since the edge or length of contact is the same on each side, the centroid of each neighbor is equidistant. However, with a fishnet grid, the Queen's Case (above/below/right/left) neighbor's centroids are N units away, while the centroids of the diagonal (Rook) neighbors are farther away (exactly the square root of 2 times N units away).
- Since the distance between centroids is the same in all six directions with hexagons, if you are using a distance band to find neighbors or are using the Optimized Hot Spot Analysis, Optimized Outlier Analysis or Create Space Time Cube By Aggregating Points tools, you will have more neighbors included in the calculations for each feature if you are using hexagonal grid as opposed to a fishnet grid.

Now, to again illustrate the differences of different approaches, let's see what this map would look like with: 

a) rectangular binning: 

```{r}

ggmap(mcr_basemap) + 
  stat_bin2d(data = manchester_asb, aes(x = Longitude, 
                                         y = Latitude)) + 
  scale_fill_gradientn(colours = c("white","red"), 
                       name = "Frequency") 

```


b) hexagonal binning: 

```{r}

ggmap(mcr_basemap) + 
  coord_cartesian() +
  stat_binhex(data = manchester_asb, aes(x = Longitude, 
                                         y = Latitude)) + 
  scale_fill_gradientn(colours = c("white","red"), 
                       name = "Frequency")

```


c) a simple heatmap:

```{r}

ggmap(mcr_basemap) + 
  stat_density2d(data = manchester_asb, aes(x = Longitude, 
                     y = Latitude, 
                     fill = ..level.., # value corresponding to discretized density estimates 
                     alpha = ..level..), 
                 geom = "polygon") +  # creates the bands of differenc dolors
  ## Configure the colors, transparency and panel
  scale_fill_gradientn(colours = c("white","red"), 
                       name = "Frequency")

##Homework 10.3 

Look at the difference between the three maps (hex, rectangle, and density). How would your conclusions change if you were given these maps? Would you make different decisions about where to place your booths for the days of action? Why or why not? Discuss. 


##Multivariate binning 
Multivariate binning is another binning method that lets you visualise slightly more complex data. In this method there can be many different variables consisting of different types of data. Like other binning methods the data is typically grouped with the sum or average of the data. Different types of symbology (such as size, shape and color) can also be used to represent this data as well.

We won't be covering this here but just so you can have a look at some examples [here](https://mgimond.github.io/Spatial/data-manipulation-in-r.html). 

##Benefits of Binning
Because of the plethora of data types available and the wide variety of projects being done in GIS, binning is a popular method for mapping complex data and making it meaningful. Binning is a good option for map makers as well as users because it makes data easy to understand and it can be both static and interactive on many different map scales. If every different point were shown on a map it would have to be a very large scale map to ensure that the data points did not overlap and were easily understood by people using the maps.

According to Kenneth Field, an Esri Research Cartographer, “Data binning is a great alternative for mapping large point-based data sets which allows us to tell a better story without interpolation.  Binning is a way of converting point-based data into a regular grid of polygons so that each polygon represents the aggregation of points that fall within it.”

By using binning to create categories of data maps are easier to understand, more accurate and more visually appealing.

Hexbin plots can be viewed as an alternative to scatter plots. The hexagon-shaped bins were introduced to plot densely packed sunflower plots. They can be used to plot scatter plots with high-density data.


#10.5 A final note of caution: MAUP

Now that we've shown you how to do a lot of spatial crime analysis, we wanted to close with some words of caution. Remember that everything you've learned here are just tools that you will be applying to data you are working with, but it's up to you, the researcher, the analyst, the domain expert, to apply and use these with careful consideration and cautions. This discussion is very much part of spatial crime analysis, and an important field of thought. 


I borrow here from George Renghert and Brian Lockwood: 

> When spatial analysis of crime is conducted, the analyst should not ignore the spatial units that data are aggregated into and the impact of this choice on the interpretation of findings. Just as several independent variables are considered to determine whether they have statistical significance, a consideration of multiple spatial units of analysis should be made as well, in order to determine whether the choice of aggregation level used in a spatial analysis can result in biased findings.


In particular, they highlight four main issues inherent in most studies of space:
- issues associated with politically bounded units of aggregation, 
- edge effects of bounded space
- the modifiable aerial unit problem (MAUP)
- and ways in which the results of statistical analyses can be manipulated by changes in the level of
aggregation. 


In this lab we will focus on **MAUP**, but if you are interested in this kind of work, you should definitely read their paper to consider the other issues as well. There are techniques that can be used to alleviate each of the methodological difficulties, and they are described in accessible detail in their paper: [Rengert, George F., and Brian Lockwood. "Geographical units of analysis and the analysis of crime." Putting crime in its place. Springer, New York, NY, 2009. 109-122.](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-0-387-09688-9_5)



##What is MAUP?

The Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP) is an important issue for those who conduct spatial analysis using units of analysis at aggregations higher than incident level. It is one of the better-known problems in geography and spatial analysis. This phenomenon illustrates both the need for considering space in one’s analysis, and the fundamental uncertainties that accompany real-world analysis.

The MAUP is "a problem arising from the imposition of artificial units of spatial reporting on continuous geographical phenomena, leading to artifacts or errors are created when one groups data into units for analysis. 


The classic text on MAUP is the 1983 paper [Openshaw, Stan. "The modifiable areal unit problem. CATMOG (Concepts and techniques in modern geography) 38." Geo Abstracts, Norwich. 1984.](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/sv/iss/SGO9010/openshaw1983.pdf).

There are two distinct types of MAUP: Scale (i.e. determining the appropriate size of units for aggregation) and zone (i.e. drawing boundaries or grouping).


###Scale 

The scale problem involves results that change based on data that are analyzed at higher or lower levels of aggregation (Changing the number of units). For example, evaluating data at the state level vs. Census tract level.

The scale problem has moved to the forefront of geographical criminology as a result of the recent interest in small-scale geographical units of analysis.  It has been suggested that smaller is better since small areas can be directly perceived by individuals and are likely to be more homogenous than larger areas. 
- [Gerell, Manne. "Smallest is better? The spatial distribution of arson and the modifiable areal unit problem." Journal of quantitative criminology 33.2 (2017): 293-318.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10940-016-9297-6)

###Zone

The zonal problem involves keeping the same scale of research (say, at the state level) but changing the actual shape and size of those areas.


The basic issue with the MAUP is that aggregate units of analysis are often arbitrarily produced by whom ever is in charge of creating the aggregate units. A classic example of this problem is known as Gerrymandering. Gerrymandering involves shaping and re-shaping voting districts based on the political affiliations of the resident citizenry. 


The inherent problem with the MAUP and with situations such as Gerrymandering is that units of analysis are not based on geographic principles, and instead are based on political and social biases. For researchers and practitioners the MAUP has very important implications for research findings because it is possible that as arbitrarily defined units of analysis change shape findings based on these units will change as well.


When spatial data are derived from counting or averaging data within areal units, the form of those areal units affects the data recorded, and any statistical measures derived from the data. Modifying the areal units therefore changes the data. Two effects are involved: a zoning effect arising from the particular choice of areas at a given scale; and an aggregation effect arising from the extent to which data are aggregated over smaller or larger areas. The modifiable areal unit problem arises in part from edge effect.


If you're interested, in particular about politics and voting, you can read this interesting piece to learn [more about gerrymandering](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-maps/)


##Why does MAUP matter?

The practical implications of MAUP are immense for almost all decision-making processes involving GIS technology, since with the availability of aggregated maps, policy could easily focus on issues and problems which might look different if the aggregation scheme used were changed .

All studies based on geographical areas are susceptible to MAUP. The implications of the MAUP affect potentially any area level data, whether direct measures or complex model-based estimates. Here are a few examples of situations where the MAUP is expected to make a difference:

- The special case of the ecological fallacy is always present when Census area data are used to formulate and evaluate policies that address problems at individual level, such as deprivation. Also, it is recognised that a potential source of error in the analysis of Census data is ‘the arrangement of continuous space into defined regions for purposes of data reporting’ 
- The MAUP has an impact on indices derived from areal data, such as measures of segregation, which can change significantly as a result of using different geographical levels of analysis to derive composite measures .
- The choice of boundaries for reporting mortality ratios is not without consequences: when the areas are too small, the values estimated are unstable, while when the areas are too large, the values reported may be over-smoothed, i.e. meaningful variation may be lost .
- [Gerell, Manne. "Smallest is better? The spatial distribution of arson and the modifiable areal unit problem." Journal of quantitative criminology 33.2 (2017): 293-318.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10940-016-9297-6)



##What can we do?

Most often you will just have to remain aware of the MAUP and it's possible effects. There are some techniques, that can help you address these issues, and the chapter pointed out at the beginning of this section is a great place to start to explore these. It is possible to use also an alternative, zone-free approach to mapping these crime patterns, perhaps by using kernel density estimation. Here we model the relative density of the points as a density surface - essentially a function of location (x,y) representing the relative likelihood of occurrence of an event at that point. We have covered KDE elsewhere in this course. 


For the purposes of this course, it's enough that you know of, and understand the MAUP and its implications. Always be smart when choosing your appropriate spatial unit of analysis, and when you use binning of any form, make sure you consider how and if your conclusions might change compared to another possible approach. 


##Homework 10.4
